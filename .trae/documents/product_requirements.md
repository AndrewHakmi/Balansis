# Balansis: Product Requirements Document

## 1. Product Overview

**Balansis** is a Python mathematical library implementing Absolute Compensation Theory (ACT) - a novel framework replacing traditional zero and infinity with Absolute and Eternity concepts for enhanced computational stability.

The library addresses fundamental mathematical instabilities (division by zero, overflows) by introducing alternative number types and operations based on balance, structural symmetry, and stability principles. Target users include researchers, developers, and mathematicians working in AI, cryptography, distributed systems, physics, and finance who need stable mathematical operations without traditional zero/infinity limitations.
